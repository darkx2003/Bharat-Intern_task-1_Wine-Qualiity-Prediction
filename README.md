# Bharat-Intern_task-2_Wine-Qualiity-Prediction

## Introduction
This repository contains the code for a machine learning model that predicts the quality of wine using a dataset called "winequality.csv". The model is implemented using linear regression.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Installation
To run the code, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you need to install the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip: pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn


## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file, `Wine_Quality_Prediction.ipynb`, using Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run each cell in the notebook to execute the code and see the results.
4. The notebook contains step-by-step explanations of the code and visualizations of the dataset.

## Results
The model uses linear regression to predict the quality of wine based on the given features. The dataset includes various attributes such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, and the corresponding wine quality.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model is "winequality.csv". It contains information about different attributes of the wine samples and their corresponding quality ratings on a scale from 0 to 10.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the implementation of a linear regression model for wine quality prediction. By analyzing the dataset and training the model, accurate predictions can be made based on the provided features.

Feel free to explore the code and make improvements for your specific use cases!
